\item It is HIGHLY recommended that you join the \#monero-\/dev IRC channel if you are developing software that uses Monero. Due to the nature of this open source software project, joining this channel and idling is the best way to stay updated on best practices and new developments in the Monero ecosystem. All you need to do is join the IRC channel and idle to stay updated with the latest in Monero development. If you do not, you risk wasting resources on developing integrations that are not compatible with the Monero network. The Monero core team and community continuously make efforts to communicate updates, developments, and documentation via other platforms â€“ but for the best information, you need to talk to other Monero developers, and they are on IRC. \#monero-\/dev is about Monero development, not getting help about using Monero, or help about development of other software, including yours, unless it also pertains to Monero code itself. For these cases, checkout \#monero.

\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}
Monero is a private, secure, untraceable, decentralised digital currency. You are your bank, you control your funds, and nobody can trace your transfers unless you allow them to do so.

{\bfseries{Privacy\+:}} Monero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain (the ledger of transactions that everyone has). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain private by default.

{\bfseries{Security\+:}} Using the power of a distributed peer-\/to-\/peer consensus network, every transaction on the network is cryptographically secured. Individual wallets have a 25-\/word mnemonic seed that is only displayed once and can be written down to backup the wallet. Wallet files should be encrypted with a strong passphrase to ensure they are useless if ever stolen.

{\bfseries{Untraceability\+:}} By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of a certain type of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure that transactions are not only untraceable but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.

{\bfseries{Decentralization\+:}} The utility of Monero depends on its decentralised peer-\/to-\/peer consensus network -\/ anyone should be able to run the monero software, validate the integrity of the blockchain, and participate in all aspects of the monero network using consumer-\/grade commodity hardware. Decentralization of the monero network is maintained by software development that minimizes the costs of running the monero software and inhibits the proliferation of specialized, non-\/commodity hardware.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{About this project}\label{md_README_autotoc_md9}
This is the core implementation of Monero. It is open source and completely free to use without restrictions, except for those specified in the license agreement below. There are no restrictions on anyone creating an alternative implementation of Monero that uses the protocol and network in a compatible manner.

As with many development projects, the repository on Git\+Hub is considered to be the \char`\"{}staging\char`\"{} area for the latest changes. Before changes are merged into that branch on the main repository, they are tested by individual developers in their own branches, submitted as a pull request, and then subsequently tested by contributors who focus on testing and code reviews. That having been said, the repository should be carefully considered before using it in a production environment, unless there is a patch in the repository for a particular show-\/stopping issue you are experiencing. It is generally a better idea to use a tagged release for stability.

{\bfseries{Anyone is welcome to contribute to Monero\textquotesingle{}s codebase!}} If you have a fix or code change, feel free to submit it as a pull request directly to the \char`\"{}master\char`\"{} branch. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not affect other parts of the codebase, it may be merged in immediately by any one of the collaborators. On the other hand, if the change is particularly large or complex, it is expected that it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{Supporting the project}\label{md_README_autotoc_md10}
Monero is a 100\% community-\/sponsored endeavor. If you want to join our efforts, the easiest thing you can do is support the project financially. Both Monero and Bitcoin donations can be made to {\bfseries{donate.\+getmonero.\+org}} if using a client that supports the \href{https://openalias.org}{\texttt{ Open\+Alias}} standard. Alternatively, you can send XMR to the Monero donation address via the {\ttfamily donate} command (type {\ttfamily help} in the command-\/line wallet for details).

Monero uses a fixed-\/schedule software upgrade (hard fork) mechanism to implement new features. This means that users of Monero (end users and service providers) should run current versions and upgrade their software on a regular schedule. Software upgrades occur during the months of April and October. The required software for these upgrades will be available prior to the scheduled date. Please check the repository prior to this date for the proper Monero software version. Below is the historical schedule and the projected schedule for the next upgrade. Dates are provided in the format YYYY-\/\+MM-\/\+DD.

Approximately three months prior to a scheduled software upgrade, a branch from master will be created with the new release version tag. Pull requests that address bugs should then be made to both master and the new release branch. Pull requests that require extensive review and testing (generally, optimizations and new features) should {\itshape not} be made to the release branch.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysection{Compiling Monero from source}\label{md_README_autotoc_md15}

The following table summarizes the tools and libraries required to build. A few of the libraries are also included in this repository (marked as \char`\"{}\+Vendored\char`\"{}). By default, the build uses the library installed on the system and ignores the vendored sources. However, if no library is found installed on the system, then the vendored source will be built and used. The vendored sources are also used for statically-\/linked builds because distribution packages often include only shared library binaries ({\ttfamily .so}) but not static library archives ({\ttfamily .a}).

Monero is also available as a port or package as {\ttfamily monero-\/cli}.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysubsection{On Open\+BSD\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md24}
You will need to add a few packages to your system. {\ttfamily pkg\+\_\+add cmake gmake zeromq libiconv boost}.

The {\ttfamily doxygen} and {\ttfamily graphviz} packages are optional and require the xbase set. Running the test suite also requires {\ttfamily py-\/requests} package.

Build monero\+: {\ttfamily env DEVELOPER\+\_\+\+LOCAL\+\_\+\+TOOLS=1 BOOST\+\_\+\+ROOT=/usr/local gmake release-\/static}

Check that the dependencies are present\+: {\ttfamily pkg\+\_\+info -\/c libexecinfo boost-\/headers boost-\/libs protobuf readline libusb1 zeromq git-\/base pkgconf gmake cmake $\vert$ more}, and install any that are reported missing, using {\ttfamily pkg\+\_\+add} or from your pkgsrc tree. Readline is optional but worth having.

Third-\/party dependencies are usually under {\ttfamily /usr/pkg/}, but if you have a custom setup, adjust the \char`\"{}/usr/pkg\char`\"{} (below) accordingly.

Clone the monero repository recursively and checkout the most recent release as described above. Then build monero\+: {\ttfamily gmake BOOST\+\_\+\+ROOT=/usr/pkg LDFLAGS=\char`\"{}-\/\+Wl,-\/\+R/usr/pkg/lib\char`\"{} release}.

The required packages are the names for each toolchain on apt. Depending on your distro, they may have different names. The {\ttfamily depends} system has been tested on Ubuntu 18.\+04 and 20.\+04.

Using {\ttfamily depends} might also be easier to compile Monero on Windows than using MSYS. Activate Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with a distro (for example Ubuntu), install the apt build-\/essentials and follow the {\ttfamily depends} steps as depicted above.

The produced binaries still link libc dynamically. If the binary is compiled on a current distribution, it might not run on an older distribution with an older installation of libc. Passing {\ttfamily -\/DBACKCOMPAT=ON} to cmake will make sure that the binary will run on systems having at least libc version 2.\+17.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysection{Installing Monero from a package}\label{md_README_autotoc_md29}

The build places the binary in {\ttfamily bin/} sub-\/directory within the build directory from which cmake was invoked (repository root by default). To run in the foreground\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./bin/monerod}

\end{DoxyCode}


To list all available options, run {\ttfamily ./bin/monerod -\/-\/help}. Options can be specified either on the command line or in a configuration file passed by the {\ttfamily -\/-\/config-\/file} argument. To specify an option in the configuration file, add a line with the syntax {\ttfamily argumentname=value}, where {\ttfamily argumentname} is the name of the argument without the leading dashes, for example, {\ttfamily log-\/level=1}.

To run in background\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./bin/monerod -\/-\/log-\/file monerod.log -\/-\/detach}

\end{DoxyCode}


To run as a systemd service, copy \href{utils/systemd/monerod.service}{\texttt{ monerod.\+service}} to {\ttfamily /etc/systemd/system/} and \href{utils/conf/monerod.conf}{\texttt{ monerod.\+conf}} to {\ttfamily /etc/}. The \href{utils/systemd/monerod.service}{\texttt{ example service}} assumes that the user {\ttfamily monero} exists and its home is the data directory specified in the \href{utils/conf/monerod.conf}{\texttt{ example config}}.

If you\textquotesingle{}re on Mac, you may need to add the {\ttfamily -\/-\/max-\/concurrency 1} option to monero-\/wallet-\/cli, and possibly monerod, if you get crashes refreshing.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md35}{}\doxysubsection{Internationalization}\label{md_README_autotoc_md35}
See README.i18n.md.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md36}{}\doxysubsection{Using Tor}\label{md_README_autotoc_md36}
\begin{quote}
There is a new, still experimental, integration with Tor. The feature allows connecting over IPv4 and Tor simultaneously -\/ IPv4 is used for relaying blocks and relaying transactions received by peers whereas Tor is used solely for relaying transactions received over local RPC. This provides privacy and better protection against surrounding node (sybil) attacks. \end{quote}
While Monero isn\textquotesingle{}t made to integrate with Tor, it can be used wrapped with torsocks, by setting the following configuration parameters and environment variables\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/p2p-\/bind-\/ip 127.\+0.\+0.\+1} on the command line or {\ttfamily p2p-\/bind-\/ip=127.\+0.\+0.\+1} in monerod.\+conf to disable listening for connections on external interfaces.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/no-\/igd} on the command line or {\ttfamily no-\/igd=1} in monerod.\+conf to disable IGD (UPnP port forwarding negotiation), which is pointless with Tor.
\item {\ttfamily DNS\+\_\+\+PUBLIC=tcp} or {\ttfamily DNS\+\_\+\+PUBLIC=tcp\+://x.x.\+x.\+x} where x.\+x.\+x.\+x is the IP of the desired DNS server, for DNS requests to go over TCP, so that they are routed through Tor. When IP is not specified, monerod uses the default list of servers defined in \href{src/common/dns_utils.cpp}{\texttt{ src/common/dns\+\_\+utils.\+cpp}}.
\item {\ttfamily TORSOCKS\+\_\+\+ALLOW\+\_\+\+INBOUND=1} to tell torsocks to allow monerod to bind to interfaces to accept connections from the wallet. On some Linux systems, torsocks allows binding to localhost by default, so setting this variable is only necessary to allow binding to local LAN/\+VPN interfaces to allow wallets to connect from remote hosts. On other systems, it may be needed for local wallets as well.
\item Do NOT pass {\ttfamily -\/-\/detach} when running through torsocks with systemd, (see \href{utils/systemd/monerod.service}{\texttt{ utils/systemd/monerod.\+service}} for details).
\item If you use the wallet with a Tor daemon via the loopback IP (eg, 127.\+0.\+0.\+1\+:9050), then use {\ttfamily -\/-\/untrusted-\/daemon} unless it is your own hidden service.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Example command line to start monerod through Tor\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{DNS\_PUBLIC=tcp torsocks monerod -\/-\/p2p-\/bind-\/ip 127.0.0.1 -\/-\/no-\/igd}

\end{DoxyCode}


A helper script is in contrib/tor/monero-\/over-\/tor.\+sh. It assumes Tor is installed already, and runs Tor and Monero with the right configuration.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md37}{}\doxysubsubsection{Using Tor on Tails}\label{md_README_autotoc_md37}
TAILS ships with a very restrictive set of firewall rules. Therefore, you need to add a rule to allow this connection too, in addition to telling torsocks to allow inbound connections. Full example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo iptables -\/I OUTPUT 2 -\/p tcp -\/d 127.0.0.1 -\/m tcp -\/-\/dport 18081 -\/j ACCEPT}

\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md38}{}\doxysubsection{Pruning}\label{md_README_autotoc_md38}
As of April 2022, the full Monero blockchain file is about 130 GB. One can store a pruned blockchain, which is about 45 GB. A pruned blockchain can only serve part of the historical chain data to other peers, but is otherwise identical in functionality to the full blockchain. To use a pruned blockchain, it is best to start the initial sync with {\ttfamily -\/-\/prune-\/blockchain}. However, it is also possible to prune an existing blockchain using the {\ttfamily monero-\/blockchain-\/prune} tool or using the {\ttfamily -\/-\/prune-\/blockchain} {\ttfamily monerod} option with an existing chain. If an existing chain exists, pruning will temporarily require disk space to store both the full and pruned blockchains.

This section contains general instructions for debugging failed installs or problems encountered with Monero. First, ensure you are running the latest version built from the Git\+Hub repo.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md40}{}\doxysubsubsection{Obtaining stack traces and core dumps on Unix systems}\label{md_README_autotoc_md40}
We generally use the tool {\ttfamily gdb} (GNU debugger) to provide stack trace functionality, and {\ttfamily ulimit} to provide core dumps in builds which crash or segfault.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To use {\ttfamily gdb} in order to obtain a stack trace for a build that has stalled\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}

Run the build.

Once it stalls, enter the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{gdb /path/to/monerod `pidof monerod`}

\end{DoxyCode}


Type {\ttfamily thread apply all bt} within gdb in order to obtain the stack trace


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If however the core dumps or segfaults\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}

Enter {\ttfamily ulimit -\/c unlimited} on the command line to enable unlimited filesizes for core dumps

Enter {\ttfamily echo core $\vert$ sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core\+\_\+pattern} to stop cores from being hijacked by other tools

Run the build.

When it terminates with an output along the lines of \char`\"{}\+Segmentation fault (core dumped)\char`\"{}, there should be a core dump file in the same directory as monerod. It may be named just {\ttfamily core}, or {\ttfamily core.\+xxxx} with numbers appended.

You can now analyse this core dump with {\ttfamily gdb} as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{gdb /path/to/monerod /path/to/dumpfile`}

\end{DoxyCode}


Print the stack trace with {\ttfamily bt}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If a program crashed and cores are managed by systemd, the following can also get a stack trace for that crash\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{coredumpctl -\/1 gdb}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md41}{}\doxyparagraph{To run Monero within gdb\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md41}
Type {\ttfamily gdb /path/to/monerod}

Pass command-\/line options with {\ttfamily -\/-\/args} followed by the relevant arguments

Type {\ttfamily run} to run monerod\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md42}{}\doxysubsubsection{Analysing memory corruption}\label{md_README_autotoc_md42}
There are two tools available\+:\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md43}{}\doxyparagraph{ASAN}\label{md_README_autotoc_md43}
Configure Monero with the -\/D SANITIZE=ON cmake flag, eg\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build/debug \&\& cmake -\/D SANITIZE=ON -\/D CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug ../..}

\end{DoxyCode}


You can then run the monero tools normally. Performance will typically halve.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md44}{}\doxyparagraph{valgrind}\label{md_README_autotoc_md44}
Install valgrind and run as {\ttfamily valgrind /path/to/monerod}. It will be very slow.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md45}{}\doxysubsubsection{LMDB}\label{md_README_autotoc_md45}
Instructions for debugging suspected blockchain corruption as per @\+HYC

There is an {\ttfamily mdb\+\_\+stat} command in the LMDB source that can print statistics about the database but it\textquotesingle{}s not routinely built. This can be built with the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \string~/monero/external/db\_drivers/liblmdb \&\& make}

\end{DoxyCode}


The output of {\ttfamily mdb\+\_\+stat -\/ea $<$path to blockchain dir$>$} will indicate inconsistencies in the blocks, block\+\_\+heights and block\+\_\+info table.

The output of {\ttfamily mdb\+\_\+dump -\/s blocks $<$path to blockchain dir$>$} and {\ttfamily mdb\+\_\+dump -\/s block\+\_\+info $<$path to blockchain dir$>$} is useful for indicating whether blocks and block\+\_\+info contain the same keys.

These records are dumped as hex data, where the first line is the key and the second line is the data.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md46}{}\doxysection{Known Issues}\label{md_README_autotoc_md46}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md47}{}\doxysubsection{Protocols}\label{md_README_autotoc_md47}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md48}{}\doxysubsubsection{Socket-\/based}\label{md_README_autotoc_md48}
Because of the nature of the socket-\/based protocols that drive monero, certain protocol weaknesses are somewhat unavoidable at this time. While these weaknesses can theoretically be fully mitigated, the effort required (the means) may not justify the ends. As such, please consider taking the following precautions if you are a monero node operator\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Run {\ttfamily monerod} on a \char`\"{}secured\char`\"{} machine. If operational security is not your forte, at a very minimum, have a dedicated a computer running {\ttfamily monerod} and {\bfseries{do not}} browse the web, use email clients, or use any other potentially harmful apps on your {\ttfamily monerod} machine. {\bfseries{Do not click links or load URL/\+MUA content on the same machine}}. Doing so may potentially exploit weaknesses in commands which accept \char`\"{}localhost\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}127.\+0.\+0.\+1\char`\"{}.
\item If you plan on hosting a public \char`\"{}remote\char`\"{} node, start {\ttfamily monerod} with {\ttfamily -\/-\/restricted-\/rpc}. This is a must.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md49}{}\doxysubsubsection{Blockchain-\/based}\label{md_README_autotoc_md49}
Certain blockchain \char`\"{}features\char`\"{} can be considered \char`\"{}bugs\char`\"{} if misused correctly. Consequently, please consider the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When receiving monero, be aware that it may be locked for an arbitrary time if the sender elected to, preventing you from spending that monero until the lock time expires. You may want to hold off acting upon such a transaction until the unlock time lapses. To get a sense of that time, you can consider the remaining blocktime until unlock as seen in the {\ttfamily show\+\_\+transfers} command.
